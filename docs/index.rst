CUSIM - Superfast implementation of Word2Vec and LDA
====================================================


CUSIM is a project to speed up various ML models (e.g. topic modeling, word embedding, etc) by CUDA. It would be nice to think of it as `gensim <https://github.com/RaRe-Technologies/gensim>`_'s GPU version project. As a starting step, I implemented the most widely used word embedding model, the `word2vec <https://arxiv.org/pdf/1301.3781.pdf>`_ model, and the most representative topic model, the `LDA (Latent Dirichlet Allocation) <https://www.jmlr.org/papers/volume3/blei03a/blei03a.pdf>`_ model.
